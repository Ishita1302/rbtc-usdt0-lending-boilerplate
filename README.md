# RBTC/USDT0 Simple Lending Boilerplate

> **Goal:** a simple, runnable boilerplate that demonstrates how to:
> - Deposit **RBTC (native)** as collateral,
> - Borrow `USDT0 (ERC-20, 6 decimals)`,
> - Query prices via a simple **UmbrellaOracleAdapter** (mock),
> - Compute **health factor** — all in a few minutes.

⚠️ **Educational only. Not audited. Do NOT deploy to mainnet.**

## Quick Start (local / Replit)

1) **Install** (first run only):
```bash
npm install
```

2) **Run the end‑to‑end demo** (compiles + deploys locally + interacts):
```bash
npm run demo
```

You will see logs:
- Deployer & user addresses
- Deployed contract addresses (USDT0, Oracle, Pool)
- Account snapshots after **deposit**, **borrow**, **repay**, **withdraw**

Here's how it looks:

> On Hardhat, the "native RBTC" is just the local chain's native coin. The boilerplate treats it as RBTC for consistency.


## Deploy to Rootstock (optional)

1) Getting tRBTC

You can get tRBTC from the [Rootstock Faucet](https://faucet.rootstock.io/).  You would need at least `0.03 tRBTC` to cover deployment and transaction fees.

2) Configure Environment:

Copy `.env.example` → `.env`, and fill in the values:

```text
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
RSK_TESTNET_RPC=https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co
RSK_MAINNET_RPC=https://public-node.rsk.co
```

3) Replace Mock USDT0 with Real Address:
- The deployment script (`scripts/demo-testnet.js`) currently deploys the `MockUSDT0.sol`. For real deployments, you must use the actual USDT0 token address on Rootstock Testnet (e.g., 0x779Ded0c9e1022225f8E0630b35a9b54bE713736).

To achieve this, you need to modify your deployment script (e.g., `scripts/demo-testnet.js`) to use the existing address instead of deploying the mock token.

It should look like this:

```js
  // --- ORIGINAL CODE (Mocks deployment) ---
  // const MockUSDT0 = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockUSDT0");
  // const usdt0 = await MockUSDT0.deploy(ethers.parseUnits("1000000", 6));
  // await usdt0.waitForDeployment();
  // const usdt0Addr = await usdt0.getAddress();
  // console.log(`USDT0 : ${usdt0Addr} decimals: ${await usdt0.decimals()}n`);

  // --- REPLACEMENT CODE (Real USDT0 address) ---
  // ⚠️ Replace this placeholder with the actual Testnet USDT0 address:
  const REAL_USDT0_ADDRESS = "0x779Ded0c9e1022225f8E0630b35a9b54bE713736"; 
  const usdt0Addr = REAL_USDT0_ADDRESS;
  console.log(`USDT0 Address Used: ${usdt0Addr}`);

  // Deploy Oracle and Pool using the REAL_USDT0_ADDRESS:
  const Oracle = await ethers.getContractFactory("UmbrellaOracleAdapter");
  const oracle = await Oracle.deploy();
  await oracle.waitForDeployment();

  const LendingPool = await ethers.getContractFactory("LendingPool");
  const pool = await LendingPool.deploy(usdt0Addr, await oracle.getAddress(), 7000);
  await pool.waitForDeployment();

```

Keep the oracle mapping: `address(0)` stands for native **RBTC**; `address(USDT0)` for USDT0.

4) Prices & Oracle Configuration:
- This boilerplate uses **UmbrellaOracleAdapter** with owner‑settable prices.
- For a real integration, replace it with a production oracle (e.g. APRO/RedStone/Umbrella) and keep the `IPriceOracle` interface.

Run the custom deployment:
`npx hardhat run --network rskTestnet scripts/demo-testnet.js`

Result:

```bash

\> If you get the error: `ProviderError: insufficient funds to pay for pending and new transactions`

- Note: Ensure to have sufficient tRBTC of at least `0.003 tRBTC` to cover deployment and transaction fees.

## Contracts Overview (minimal unit)

- **contracts/LendingPool.sol**  
  Core logic to deposit native **rBTC**, borrow **USDT0**, check solvency with **LTV**, compute **health factor**.
  - `depositRBTC()` payable
  - `borrowUSDT0(amount)`
  - `repayUSDT0(amount)`
  - `withdrawRBTC(amount)`
  - `getAccountData(user)` returns collateral/debt in tokens + **USD** and **HF**

- **contracts/oracles/UmbrellaOracleAdapter.sol**  
  Simple, owner‑settable prices (USD with **18 decimals**). Replace this with a real oracle adapter later.

- **contracts/interfaces/IPriceOracle.sol**  
  Minimal interface: `getPrice(asset) → priceE18`

- **contracts/tokens/MockUSDT0.sol**  
  ERC‑20 with **6 decimals**, mintable. Used only for quick demos.

**Decimals & math**:
- Oracle returns **USD price with 18 decimals** for both assets.
- RBTC has **18 decimals**, USDT0 has **6 decimals**. The pool normalizes to **1e18** for USD math.

---

## Minimal Interaction Examples

- **Deposit** 0.01 rBTC:
```js
await pool.depositRBTC({ value: ethers.parseEther("0.01") });
```

- **Borrow** 400 USDT0:
```js
await pool.borrowUSDT0(ethers.parseUnits("400", 6));
```

- **Repay** 200 USDT0:
```js
await usdt0.approve(poolAddr, ethers.parseUnits("200", 6));
await pool.repayUSDT0(ethers.parseUnits("200", 6));
```

- **Withdraw** 0.002 rBTC (keeps HF ≥ 1):
```js
await pool.withdrawRBTC(ethers.parseEther("0.002"));
```

- **Set prices** in the mock adapter (owner only):
```js
await oracle.setBatch(
  [ethers.ZeroAddress, usdt0Addr],
  [ethers.parseUnits("65000", 18), ethers.parseUnits("1", 18)]
);
```

## Omitted features (to keep it simple)

- Interest accrual (no time‑based rates)
- aTokens/cTokens or interest‑bearing receipts
- Liquidations, close/liq factors
- Pause/role systems beyond `Ownable`
- Multiple collateral/borrow assets
- Real oracle wiring (we use a minimal mock adapter)

This boilerplate is meant as a **first step**, you can fork and extend into a full money market.
